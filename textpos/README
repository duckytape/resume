Textpos: absolute positioning of text on the LaTeX page
-------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.9.1, 2019 April 15

This package facilitates placing boxes at absolute positions on the
LaTeX page.  There are several reasons why this might be useful, but
the main one (or at least my motivating one) is to help produce a
large-format conference poster.

This package provides a single environment, plus a starred variant,
which contains the text (or graphics, or table, or whatever) which is
to be placed on the page, and which specifies where it is to be
placed.  The environment is accompanied by various configuration
commands.

For the change history, see textpos.html.

The canonical CTAN URL for Textpos is <https://ctan.org/pkg/textpos>.
Textpos has a home page at <http://purl.org/nxg/dist/textpos>.
The source is hosted at bitbucket: <https://bitbucket.org/nxg/textpos>,
and there is an issues list there, for bug reports.
